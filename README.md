# Cndtest
This project was generated with [angular-cli].
I created two components, one for each dropdown menu.
I have implemented unit tests for each component.
Styling for both makes and models component is common and can be found in 'styles.scss'.
I implemented dataservice to get the data from provided APIs.

## Steps to run the application:
1. Clone project from github to local workspace. `git clone https://github.com/rishabh-sonal/cndtest.git`
2. On terminal go to main folder cndtest and run command `npm install`.
3. Once node_modules are installed, run `ng serve` to run the application.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.
